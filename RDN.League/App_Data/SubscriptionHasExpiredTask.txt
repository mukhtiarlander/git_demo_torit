My name is Scott Pio/Veggie Delight.  I wanted to tell you that your league subscription expired %days% days ago.  Through some fault of our own, we were just not what you were willing to pay for.  So we want to change that.  What we are asking is that you reply to this email.  Let us know what we could have done to keep your league around longer.  If its something we can fix, we will gladly and happily work with you to make your leagues dreams come true. We are here for the long term and hope you are too.
<br/><br/>
We can only build %WebsiteShortName% with your leagues support.  So what can we do to support you?

<br/><br/>
Our latest services can be found here: %infomormationalVideo%
<br/>
You can resubscribe your league here: %leagueSubscriptionLink%
<br/><br/>
Thank you for reading and being apart of the family that is %WebsiteShortName%.
