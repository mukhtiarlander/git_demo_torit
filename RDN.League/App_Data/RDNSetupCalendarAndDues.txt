%WebsiteShortName% Features Set-up<br/><br/>

Now that you've got your league members registered, you can really start to take advantage of all the features %WebsiteShortName% has to offer!
<br/><br/>
The first step, is to set up your calendar. You can populate this with training times, games and league events.<br/><br/>
•	Go to the calendar icon in the header and click 'new'. The page comes up with all of the criteria required to load events onto your calendar. If you are inputting a regularly scheduled practice session (for example), you have the ability to put it on repeat for that day and time. You can also designate colours for specific events to help people to recognize them at first glance.<br/><br/>
•	The Settings icon gives you a multitude of options to set up your calendar and attendance requirements specific to your league.<br/><br/>
•	If you have an existing Google calendar, you can import that directly to RDN (import icon) and can now start to track your members' attendance to events. You also have the ability to generate reports for your records.<br/><br/>
•	You are now ready to set up your league member's dues payments. RDN is fully integrated with Paypal and you'll find everything you need on the Dues settings page. You can monitor payments, send reminders to your members and print reports.
