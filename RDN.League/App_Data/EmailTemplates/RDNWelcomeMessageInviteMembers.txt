Welcome to %WebsiteShortName%!<br/><br/>
We want to make your league administration as simple as possible and allow you more time for playing! <br/><br/>
Here are some tips for getting your league registered and communicating better: <br/><br/>
First and foremost, register all of your league members. We have found that having one or two central administrators is the most effective way to set up your forum and committee groups. <br/><br/>
•	Go to the members section of your league, and in the top right corner, click 'add'. Here you can enter your member's names, skate numbers, emails and phone numbers. <br/><br/>
•	Once you have done that, ask your members to go to %publicWebsite%/signup so they can register. You can then ask them to verify their profiles, add photos and any descriptions they like. Members that have registered can now be 'invited to join your league'. <br/><br/>
•	At the bottom of your Members' page there will be a 'join code' that can now be sent to your league members that have registered on %WebsiteShortName%. When they sign in to RDN, ask them to hover over their email address in the top right corner and a drop down menu will appear. They can enter the join code and that will allow them to access your league's page and all the features of RDN. <br/><br/>
•	You can now begin to set up 'groups' in your forum. These can be used for specific committees, your BoD, teams or whatever you like. Within these groups, you can add the appropriate members and give them a 'member type'. These allow for access to administering the group with specific permissions. <br/><br/>
•	Forum-wide permissions can be allocated for certain members who oversee several groups or for Directors/Secretaries of your league. (See 'permissions') <br/><br/><br/>

We hope that this has been helpful to you, there is a Help section that can guide you through further steps to setting up other aspects of your league and as always, should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us at %DefaultInfoEmail%. <br/><br/>
We're so pleased to have you with us!
