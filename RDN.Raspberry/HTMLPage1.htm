            First out on this is our new Scoreboard for Roller Derby which is finally out of beta-testing. (Thanks to all of you that helped us with this part). The Scoreboard is one of the corner stones in our plans to enchance roller derby. For you that don't know, the Scoreboard Thor's Hammer features everything needed for a successful game/scrimmage. It will as of next version also display game stats on our webpage, rdnation.com.
Get it now, it's free (and will always be free), Thor's Hammer: http://rdnation.com/scoreboard.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: verdana;">
            Next up on our agenda is to integrade Thor's Hammer and RDNation.com. This will make it possible for you (optional) to display game statistics from your game/scrimmage on our webpage. We want the world to know of your team and their victories. Our hopes is that this will be finished during April or beginning of May.

        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: verdana;">
            Next out on our lofty mission to restore Roller Derby’s honor in the world of sports
            is a membership management system. The membership system will be just like a payroll
            system at a job. There will be interaction between the scoreboard software and the
            management system we hope will make booking and setting up games much easier. It
            will allow you to organize your roster, collect dues, manage contacts, see past
            scores etc...
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: verdana;">
            We will be building countless other applications for the sport of Roller Derby.
            Keep looking out for us, as we hope to change every aspect of how Roller Derby is
            viewed, managed and even how the fans interact with teams and their skaters. Stay tuned at <a href="http://rdnation.com">RDNation.com</a>
