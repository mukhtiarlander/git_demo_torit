    </div>
    
    <div>
        Only use this to delete the Tournament entirely in case their are duplicates or something
        like that.  This is a final delete, no going back and it deletes just the league, not the members of the league.</div>

    
    <input type="submit" class="primary" />
    
    
    if (Model.IsDeleted)
    { 
    <div>Tournament IS DELETED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>
    
    }
