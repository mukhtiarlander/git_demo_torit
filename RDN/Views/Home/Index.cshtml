                <h3>Attendance Tracking & Calendar</h3>
                Each league gets a calendar.  The calendar is used to schedule events, set RSVP availability, track attendance and show the locations of those such events. The attendance tracking software is based on the popular points based system most leagues use.

                <h3>Dues Management</h3>
                Leagues can manage their dues collections with RDNation. Your league can track each payment of each member month by month.  You can waive payments, manage payments and remove those payments.  You can view in/out going payments, view how much is still required and sent notifications to those requiring payment. Your members can even pay through RDNation!

                <h3>Document Repository</h3>
                Each league gets their own document repository.  This is the place to store all your important league documents that every member has access to.  We give you a full 5GBs of space to start storing any document you want.  Each document can also be commented on with the comments being saved directly in RDNation.

                <h3>Groups, Teams and Committees</h3>
                Feel free to seperate your members out in groups within RDNation.  Have a few committees, teams and steering committees?  They can communicate with each other at RDNation.  Having their own forums for each group greatly enhances their ability to communicate effectively.
